 # Introduction (proposed)

 ## Why Agri Farm?
 
 Farmers know that even a small operation requires intensive recordkeeping. A well-run
 farm requires proper management of accounting, payroll, suppliers, customers and 
 logistics to name a few areas. ERPNext already helps organize these activities.
 
 A farm requires additional attention to manage its productive units (plots of land), 
 time sensitive crop activities (such as planting, irrigating, fertilizing, etc.), 
 recordingenvironmental and crop data for analysis, and reports to help make effective 
 decisions.
 
 ## What is Agri Farm?
 
 The Agriculture module in ERPNext helps you keep track of your farming operations. 
 It allows you keep records for each field where you farm, such as geospatial and 
 soil texture characteristics. It allows you to:
 * Manage the physical spaces where you plant your crops
 * Manage your crops
 * Record analysis data
 * Plan activities related to your crops
 * Plan fertilizer formulations
 * Record sale of the harvest or transfer to warehouse for further processing
 * View reports
